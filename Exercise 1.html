<h1 Id="title" style="background-color: rgb(134, 145, 89);">An explanation of A Locomotive Engineer's Schedule</h1>

<p>A locomotive engineer, on the extra board, I work on call five days a week.  I am called by the <em>Crew Caller</em>, and must arrive at the starting terminal within two hours.  This can cause conflict with appointments, family gatherings and <strong>classes</strong>.
</p>
<p>The days of the week based on likelyhood of geting called in are as follows:  <em>(Ordered from most to least likely)</em>
    <ol><li>Thursday</li>
    <li>Friday</li>
    <li>Saturday</li>
    <li>Tuesday</li>
    <li>Wednesday</li>
    <li>Sunday</li>
    <li>Monday</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2 Id="bio">Off Days</h2>
<p>My Days off are currently <mark>Sunday/Monday</mark>. I am able to change these days once a month.  These days are awarded based on seniority.</p>

<h3> Call Hours</h3>

<p>The hours that I must protect the extra board start at 00:01 the day after my second off day, to 18:00 the day before my first off day. This means that it is possible to work into my off days, be sent out of town and not return until the middle of my second day off.  I would then recieve fourty eight hours off from the time I return home.</p>

<p>The frequency that I am called are based on these factors:
    <ul>
        <li>number of trains running</li>
        <li>number of engineers on the board</li>
        <li>how many regular engineers are off sick</li>
    </ul>
    Due to business being slow for the last two years, <mark>I generally work 1-4 days a week</mark>.
</p>
